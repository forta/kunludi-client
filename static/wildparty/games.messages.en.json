"Introducción 0":  "Ana is in the dark in the middle of the luxurious Halloween party. It had all started very well, but a while ago many guests began to stick together more and more strongly. Ana moved sneakily to the exit door of the ballroom, just at the moment the light went out and everything was filled with darkness and screams ... and the unpleasant sound of teeth chewing raw meat.",
"Introducción 1":  "Seeking refuge, Ana dodged invisible blows in the dark, although some of them stripped her of some of her northern witch clothes. In the end, on the top floor of the mansion, when he turned hopelessly one more knob, a door opened.",
"Introducción 2":  "Ana entered and was blinded for a moment by a light that fell on her face. He heard the door close behind him and when his pupils adjusted, he saw a woman with a cell phone in his hand, who looked at her with wide eyes and whispered disconsolately in Russian - Tu nyÃ© Andrey -, and retired to the back of the room, turning off the light. They are both dark.",

"te presentas 2":  "Upon arrival she felt dazzled by the high level of cars and dresses of the guests. Then, when he was required to hand over his cell phone and take the pills required to access the Halloween party, he didn't like a hair. However, as he had informed his friends and family about who he would be with this time, he felt fairly safe. The day would come when she was a responsible adult; I was still in the age of nonsense.",
"te presentas 3":  "Ana took one of the pills in front of the safety one, but took good care not to do the same with the rest of the pills, which she hid and pretended to swallow. The initial moments of the party began normally, until people began to get aggressive and fight if motive, when they took advantage to go to a safe place, just when the light went out.",

"¿Sabes algo de los zombis?":  "ask about zombies",

"zombis2":  "Ana recognizes at that time that she has only taken one pill.",
"zombis3":  "Mmm ... sooner or later it will work, but you may have time to help me before it happens to you ... or to myself. Keep the distances with me if I start behaving aggressively.",

"obligada_2":  "Ana is enraged to learn that this woman is responsible for this horror: How have they been able to do this? â€”You are angry.",
"obligada_3":  "They tricked us. We would never have agreed to research on developing drugs.

"empresario":  "It's one, Dima, new rich in gas. Exquisite ways, but without regard if you get in their way.",
"plan_0":  "The idea was to take advantage of the disorder during the party to escape after taking the antidote. We were very scared and in the middle of the manufacturing processes we have been testing toxic variants of the drug in guinea pigs. The excuse to the bosses was that we wanted to improve the formula and we needed the guinea pigs before trying the drug with tramps and then with clients.",
"plan_1":  "We discovered a variant of the drug, which drove them crazy after taking it and made them extremely aggressive. At the same time, we found a blocker of that characteristic. It should be taken after ingesting the drug, before it took effect. The product is very unstable and needs to be manufactured shortly before consumption.",
"plan_2":  "Ana, you must get the necessary ingredient to prepare the antidote. As you know, it's at the bar. If the rabid ones frighten you, take a couple of pills, that will make you lose your fear and then I will nullify the effects.",

"nota_1":  "Honey, after separating, they took me to Dima at the bar, to tell me that they would kill you if the pills caused problems. In a moment of dismissal, I was able to hide some additional capsules with the main ingredient of the antidote in a special bottle, you can imagine which one. It's just a plan b because I have capsules with the antidote prepared in an office drawer.",
"nota_2":  "After giving me a drug overdose, they beat me and left me in handcuffs, leaving the wives' keys morbidly a few meters away from me. I heard them joking with the combination of the lab door before leaving. Fuck, it's 1031, what a fucking grace.",
"nota_3":  "It's been a while since the above. I feel the blood boil, I just want to kick and bite. The only possibility I see before there is no going back is to cut my hand and take the capsules with the antidote that I left in the drawer.",

"laboratorio 1":  "But still, Ana still trusts the Russian scientific value and they leave the room holding hands, trembling before the slightest noise. Erika illuminates the access key to the laboratory with the lowest possible brightness of the mobile and they enter a second.",
"laboratorio 2":  "Before realizing just what was happening Erika takes the bloody wives and their keys, which were visible on the table, opens them and ties Ana with her to the same place where Andrey was.",
"laboratorio 3":  "Ana screams and resists. It is not only because of frustration, but because of the effect that drugs cause on it and that they are about to leave it in an irreversible state of dumbness.",
"laboratorio 4":  "Then Erika starts cooking. Its expert hands take just five minutes to get the savior antidote.",
"laboratorio 5":  "Erika takes her dose and then she must almost force Ana to swallow his.",
"laboratorio 6":  "Erika falls asleep and falls to the ground. Open the windows and wait for the sun to rise.",
"En ese caso sí te presto mi móvil.":  "In that case I do lend you my mobile. That's how desperate I am. Anyway, it is not worth calling, we are in an isolated area on the mountain, as you well know.

He sees a trail of blood that leads to a body that lacks the right hand. Many threads of blood and tissue hang from the stump, as if it had been brutally torn away, and a large pool of blood surrounds it.",
"Ana descrubre muerto, nota y labotatorio_2":  "Ana recognizes Andrey in him. It has a note on it, which it does not understand because it is written in Cyrillic, but at least it clearly identifies a number, 1031. When you try it on the keyboard access to the laboratory Ana manages to enter it.",
"Ana descrubre muerto, nota y labotatorio_3":  "In the laboratory everything is full of blood and there is a hand torn off next to some handcuffs chained to a metal anchored in the wall.

"Ana vuelve al laboratorio y acaba viendo video_3":  "Fiddling the controls of the security consoles, Ana manages to see the images of the laboratory while Andrey was still alive. It is all as he himself recounts in his note, except for the fateful final part: after freeing himself, he leaps over the drawer and eagerly takes a large number of pills. In his altered mental state, Andrey surely did not stop to think about his girlfriend and left no pills, so there is none in the drawer.",
"Ana vuelve al laboratorio y acaba viendo video_4":  "Before leaving the laboratory with a slam, the video shows Andrey writhing in pain. It is not that this antidote gives a lot of confidence applied to people, but perhaps it is the only allergy of not ending up like the rest of the rabid ones.",

"Ana se enrabieta y consigue botella_2":  "Ana follows the advice but does not notice anything strange after taking the pills she still had, at least not in the first few minutes. Then, Ana begins to sweat and feel a contempt against herself and all humanity: â€œWhy the hell did I accept the invitation of those memos? What has been believed that Erika whore manipulating me in this way? I will get the ingredient, but as soon as I have the antidote I will throw it to the rabid ones to give a good account of it. â€",
"Ana se enrabieta y consigue botella_3":  "On their way to the drinks counter, they cross several rabid ones, but they are no longer afraid of it.

"se toma una pastilla":  "you take a pill",
